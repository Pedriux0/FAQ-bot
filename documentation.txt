What’s This Project About?
Meet FAQ Bot Plus—a smart chatbot designed to answer questions using a mix of pre-set answers and clever language processing. Whether you’re chatting in a Python terminal or on Discord, this bot adapts to your needs. It uses pattern matching to recognize common questions and spaCy’s language smarts to handle curveballs it hasn’t seen before.

Key Features
1. Instant Answers with Smart Matching
The bot checks your questions against a list of pre-written FAQs. It ignores typos, capitalization, and punctuation

2. No Match? No Problem.
If your question stumps the bot, it doesn’t just give up. Instead, it:

Shares random fun facts (like “Octopuses have three hearts!”).

Sends Google Maps links for location questions (“Where’s Tokyo?” → maps.link/tokyo).

Pulls Wikipedia info for famous people, places, or organizations.

3. Discord Ready
The bot works seamlessly on Discord, responding to messages just like it does in a Python shell. Say “hello” or ask about the weather—it’s got you covered.

How It Works Under the Hood
Loading FAQs: Questions and answers are stored in a file, which the bot reads and organizes for quick access.

Cleaning Up Input: It simplifies your messages by removing punctuation and lowercase-ing everything (so “HEY!!” becomes “hey”).

Matching Questions: Uses fuzzy logic and regex patterns to guess what you’re asking, even if your wording isn’t perfect.

Handling Unknowns: When stuck, spaCy helps analyze your question. Ask about a place? You’ll get a map link. Mention a celebrity? It’ll fetch a Wikipedia summary.

Testing & Behavior
Sample Interactions:

You: “What’s the fourth dimension?”
Bot: Explains theoretical physics (using the pre-set FAQ answer).

You: “Tell me something cool.”
Bot: Shares a random fact (e.g., “Honey never spoils!”).

You: “Where’s the Eiffel Tower?”
Bot: Sends a Google Maps link to Paris.

Consistency Across Platforms: Whether on Discord or Python, the bot behaves the same way—just the interface changes.
